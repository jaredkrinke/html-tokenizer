# HTML Tokenizer and Parser
This is a fork of Greg Reimer's [html-tokenizer](https://github.com/greim/html-tokenizer), updated as follows:

* Repackaged specifically for use in Deno
* HTML entity reference decoding removed
* Collapsed code into 2 files

See [the original html-tokenizer repository](https://github.com/greim/html-tokenizer) for motivation, API reference, and examples.
